                <p>
                    The Engineer Man Knowledge Center hosts contests weekly which are done in a Code Golf format.
                    For those not familiar with Code Golf, it basically means that the winner of the contest is the person
                    who can accomplish the given objective with the least amount of code, measured in bytes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Supported languages are those which <a href="https://github.com/engineer-man/piston" target="_blank">Piston</a> supports.
                    To request new languages,
                    submit a request in #emkc-felix-piston on <a href="https://discord.gg/engineerman">Discord</a>. Our intent
                    is to add proper golfing languages over time as well as a separate leaderboard for these languages.
                </p>

                <h5 class="f300 green">Overview</h5>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Contests start at 12:00pm CDT (5:00pm UTC) on Sundays and run for 3 days ending at 12:00pm CDT (5:00pm UTC) on Wednesdays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can update your solution as many times as you want during the contest period. Submitting a solution
                        that is shorter than your last submitted solution will result in the submitted time changed. This is
                        important to understand because tiebreakers are resolved by the oldest solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Points are awarded to the shortest solutions that meet the objective both overall and per language. If there
                        are solutions that are the same length, the solution submitted the earliest will take precedent.
                        Please see <a href="/community/power">how to gain power</a> for more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leading and trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed before calculating the number of bytes used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inputs are provided as command line arguments (ARGV) and standard input (STDIN) with each
                        input separated by a newline character, you may use either one.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5 class="f300 green">Rules</h5>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        No sharing solutions or discussing approach during the contest period.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submitted solutions must pass automated code execution before they are recorded as a contest submission.
                        This is done using the <a href="https://github.com/engineer-man/piston" target="_blank">Piston</a> engine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For those using Bash, you can use any of the GNU coreutils as well as sed and awk. You may not call
                        into any of the other contest languages (julia, perl, python, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't submit duplicate solutions for similar languages (e.g. c/c++, js/ts/deno, etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solutions which depend on RNG to pass are not allowed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
